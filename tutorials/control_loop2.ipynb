    "The control module in pandapower allows you to **adjust, regulate and manipulate individual components** within a power grid. The possibilities here are many and varied and are purely up to your imagination. They range from simple controllers that make it possible, for example, to adjust and manipulate the entries of loads, feeders or storage units in the course of a time series simulation, to equipment-specific controllers such as tap changers, through to complex controllers that control the various flexibilities within a power grid. \n",

    "Compared to the other components that make up a power grid, the **controller module is rather exotic**. This is because, unlike with all other components, we had to realize that it makes less sense here to start from the classic table structure and try to embed the controllers in a fixed structure. In other words, while **buses, lines, and so on always depend on fixed variables**, this does not apply to controllers: **controllers are extremely flexible**. On the one hand, this is their strength (the possibilities here are limitless), but on the other hand it means that you lose the clear table structure that you are familiar with from the other components you have already seen.\n",
    "\n",

Even though this example is unlikely to be found in reality, it illustrates the difference between *level* and *order* quite well. If both controllers were at the same *level*, the controller loop would never converge, as the conditions of both controllers could never be fulfilled. However, if one of the controllers were at a higher *level*, each individual controller loop would again find a solution without any problems, as these two controllers are independent of each other.

The *control_step* describes the **actual control behavior of the controller**. *repair_control* enables you to make a **one-off correction for each control loop if the grid does not converge** due to the controller. For example, the handling of occurring NaN values could be described here. *finalize_control* is **executed at the end**. A typical example here is to set the converged flag back to False so that the controller is not inadvertently ingorized in the subsequent control loop.\n",
